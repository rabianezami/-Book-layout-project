# Book Layout Project

This project is a simple HTML and CSS layout that displays a book description similar to what you'd see on an online store. It includes a cover image, title, author info, rating, and a detailed book summary.

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` — main HTML structure using semantic elements
- `styles.css` — custom styling using Flexbox
- `book-cover.jpg` — image of the book

## 💡 Notes

This version is not yet responsive. Responsive design will be added in future updates.
